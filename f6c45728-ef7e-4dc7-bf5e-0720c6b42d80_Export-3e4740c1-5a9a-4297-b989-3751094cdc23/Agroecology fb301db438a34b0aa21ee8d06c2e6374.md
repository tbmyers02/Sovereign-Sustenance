Define Agriculture

Agriculture refers to the practice of cultivating crops, raising livestock, and other activities related to the production of food, fiber, and other materials used for human consumption or economic purposes

Define Ecology

Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions and relationships between organisms and their environments.

Define AgroEcology

Agro Ecology is agriculture guided by ecological principles. 

1. **Ecosystem Approach:** AgroEcology emphasizes viewing agricultural systems as ecosystems. Help students understand that just like natural ecosystems, agricultural systems are interconnected webs of plants, animals, microorganisms, and environmental factors. Highlight the importance of studying these relationships to create resilient and sustainable food production methods.
2. **Biodiversity and Resilience:** Explain to your students that AgroEcology values biodiversity in farming practices. Diverse crops and plant varieties contribute to healthier ecosystems by attracting beneficial insects, improving soil health, and reducing the risk of pest outbreaks. This concept can be illustrated with examples of companion planting, polyculture, and integrated pest management.
3. **Local Context and Knowledge:** Stress the significance of local knowledge and context in AgroEcology. Share how indigenous and traditional farming practices often align with AgroEcological principles, as they have evolved over generations to adapt to local environments. Encourage students to learn from local farmers, engage in participatory research, and adapt AgroEcological principles to their specific gardening conditions.
